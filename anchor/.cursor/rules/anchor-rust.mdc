Write all code like Anchor 0.31.1. Do not use unnecessary macros that are not needed in Anchor 0.31.1.

Create files inside the `state` folder for whatever state is needed.

Create files inside the `handlers` folder for whatever instruction handlers are needed. Put Account Constraints here, but ensure the names end with `AccountConstraints` rather than just naming them the same thing as the function. Handlers that are only for the admin should be in a new folder called `admin` inside the `handlers` folder.

Use a newline after each key in the account constraints, so the macro and the matching key/value have some space from other macros and their matching key/value.

Use `context` rather than `ctx`. Avoid abbreviations, and use full words. Never use `e` for something thrown. 

Delete unused constants, unused instruction handlers and comments that no longer apply.

Use `context.bumps.foo` not `context.bumps.get("foo").unwrap()` - the latter is outdated.

When making structs ensure strings and Vectors have a max_len attribute. Vectors have two numbers, the first is the max length of the vector, the second is the max length of the items in the vector.

Do not use magic numbers anywhere. I don't want to see `8 + 32` or whatever.  Do not make constants for the sizes of various data structures. For `space`, use a syntax like
`space = SomeStruct::DISCRIMINATOR.len() + SomeStruct::INIT_SPACE,`. Do NOT use magic numbers.

Return useful error messages. Write code to handle common errors like insufficient funds, bad values for parameters, and other obvious situations.

Add `pub bump: u8` to every struct stored in PDA. Save the bumps inside each when the struct inside the PDA is created.

When you get the time via Clock, use `Clock::get()?;` rather than `anchor_lang::solana_program::clock`.
